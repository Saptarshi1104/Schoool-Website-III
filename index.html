                    <p>Though we lost the final against JDS Kolkata,in the league stage we were the table-toppers. In the final JDS Kolkata opted to bat first and posted a target of 195 runs in 20 overs. Their score was 194-4 in 20 overs. We struggled in the first 5 overs, scoring just 32 runs and losing 3 wickets. Then our best player came to bat and made a huge partnership. Then we were 154 for 4 in 16 overs. Requiring 41 runs in 24 balls, we lost 2 wickets in the crucial 19th over, thus scoring 179 for 6 in 19 overs. In the final over we needed 16 runs.The first two balls were dots. But the next two were a four and a six then we required just a six in the last two deliveries, but that's when we blundered. It was a wicket in the 5th ball and the last we hit a four, thus scoring 193-7 in 20 overs.

                    <p>After finishing first in the points table, in the final we clashed against JDS Howrah. In the beginning we were not defending well neither attacking, in the 35th minute JDS Howrah hit the back of the net. We were worried as our main goal-scorer got injured in the 20th minute. But our captain scored the equalizer in the 43rd minute. Before the half time it was 1-1.
                        When the second half started we scored another goal in the 64th minute and now it was 2-1 in favour of us, untill the 82nd minute when JDS Howrah scored another goal. After the full time it was 2-2. So we had an extra time.
                        In the extra time we could not score goals neither JDS Howrah scored. But in the 119th minute we finally scored but it was given offside. The extra time ended and we had Penalty Shootout.
                        We scored 2 on 4 and JDS Howrah did the same. The last penalty JDS Howrah missed and we scored!

                    During our 2019 Summer Vacation, when were spending our holidays the school was putting up an ICT board in every class. Some of them were big whereas some were small. In the ICT board we are shown videos of education and sometimes movies. Also our teachers use ut as an alternate of the blackboard.Our Computer teacher shows us many things in the ICT practically which we do not understand. Our Science teacher shows us videos related to the lessons. I really like the ICT board for many reasons. It had a great impact on our classes.
